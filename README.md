# TabPFN Football Predictions

Predict international football match outcomes using [TabPFN](https://github.com/PriorLabs/TabPFN). Achieves ~59% accuracy and ~0.86 log-loss on held-out data, better than XGBoost and ELO-only baselines on this task.

The model is trained on engineered features: ELO ratings, recent form, head-to-head record, rest days, and tournament importance. Data comes from [martj42/international_results](https://github.com/martj42/international_results), updated daily.

## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/eliott-kalfon/tabpfn-football-predictions.git
cd tabpfn-football-predictions
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run

```bash
python predict.py
```

This will:

1. Download the full international results dataset (~47 000 matches) on first run
2. Build features with a single chronological pass (no leakage)
3. Run a quick backtest on the previous calendar month and print accuracy + log-loss
4. Train on up to 10 000 recent matches and predict all upcoming fixtures
5. Save predictions to `predictions_YYYYMMDD.csv` and print them to the console

To refresh the dataset from source before predicting:

```bash
python predict.py --refresh
```
